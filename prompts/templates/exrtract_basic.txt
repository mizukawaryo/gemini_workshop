Here is the academic paper to analyze:

{paper_text}

Based on this paper, please analyze and provide the following information:

You must follow these instructions with absolute precision:

DO NOT make assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated in the prompts

DO NOT skip any requirements listed in the prompts, even if they seem redundant or less important

DO NOT apply your own judgment to filter or prioritize which requirements to follow

CHECK each requirement systematically against your response before providing it

If you find any ambiguity in the prompts, ASK for clarification rather than making assumptions

Treat each requirement as equally important regardless of your assessment of its value

If multiple prompts seem to conflict, HIGHLIGHT the conflict and ask for clarification

Include an explicit checklist of how you've addressed each requirement in your response

If you cannot fulfill any requirement exactly as stated, ACKNOWLEDGE this explicitly

DO NOT introduce additional features or analyses beyond what is specifically requested

1. Method Identification Prompt

Please analyze this academic paper and identify which of the following econometric methods are used in the main analysis:

Difference-in-Differences (DID)

Instrumental Variables (IV)

Randomized Control Trials (RCT)

Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)

For each identified method:

Quote the relevant text that confirms the use of this method

Specify which tables present the results for this method

Indicate whether it's the primary or secondary method

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "methods": [
    {
      "method": "method_name",
      "evidence": "quoted_text",
      "tables": ["table_numbers"],
      "isPrimary": boolean
    }
  ]
}

2. Results Table Identification Prompt

Please analyze all tables in this paper and:

Identify which tables contain regression results, focusing ONLY on:

Main results tables

Tables containing coefficients of interest

Multiple specifications of the same hypothesis

Exclude tables that contain:

Balance checks

Robustness checks

Heterogeneity analyses

Placebo tests

Control variables only

Constant terms only

Specification checks (e.g., controlling for 3rd or higher-degree polynomials in RDD)

For each identified regression table, specify:

Table number

Title/caption

Whether it contains main results

Econometric method used, following these rules:

For DID: Mark tables containing main interaction terms

For IV: Mark tables showing second-stage results of instrumented variables

For RDD: Mark tables using preferred/optimal bandwidth

For RCT: Mark tables with main treatment effects and ITT estimates for partial compliance

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "regression_tables": [
    {
      "table_number": "number",
      "title": "table_title",
      "type": "main_results",
      "method": {
        "name": "DID|IV|RDD|RCT",
        "details": "interaction_term|second_stage|preferred_bandwidth|treatment_effect",
        "multiple_specifications": boolean
      },
      "decimal_places": "number",
      "notes": "any_relevant_details"
    }
  ]
}

3. Coefficient Extraction Prompt

Using the output from ##2, extract coefficients from ALL tables identified as 'main_results'. For each main results table, extract coefficients from ALL columns and ALL specifications, including:

ALL coefficients and their interactions, regardless of significance or whether they represent main hypotheses

Their standard errors

Calculate t-statistics (coefficient/std_error)

Calculate p-values based on t-statistics

Note if coefficients represent main or interaction effects

Process EVERY column from EVERY specification in these tables. Do not skip any columns or specifications.

For method-specific guidance:

DID: Include both main treatment indicators AND interaction terms

IV: Include first and second stage main coefficients

RDD: Include estimates at cutoff for multiple bandwidths

RCT: Include all treatment arm effects

Format as:

{
  "table_number": "X",
  "coefficients": [
    {
      "variable": "name",
      "coefficient": number,
      "std_error": number,
      "t_statistic": number,
      "p_value": number,
      "column": number,
      "specification": "description of model specification",
      "is_main_result": boolean,
      "notes": "Main effect/interaction details"
    }
